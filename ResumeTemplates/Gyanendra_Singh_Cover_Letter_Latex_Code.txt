Dear Hiring Manager,

\bigskip

I am writing to express my interest in the Backend Engineer position. With over 3 years of hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and high-performance backend systems at Bosch Global Software Technologies, I bring a deep expertise in Java, Spring Boot, microservices architecture, and AWS-based cloud development that aligns well with your organization’s goals.

At Bosch, I have led the development of RESTful APIs for vehicle security systems, optimized latency by over 60\% using Redis caching, and implemented robust authentication mechanisms using JWT and RBAC. My contributions extended beyond coding, including upgrading cryptographic standards (AES-256, PBKDF2), containerizing legacy Java apps with Docker, and mentoring junior developers in Agile environments. These experiences have strengthened my ability to deliver enterprise-grade backend solutions that are both performant and secure.

I take pride in applying best practices in DevOps and testing—utilizing tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, RestAssured, JUnit, and SonarQube—to ensure maintainability and CI/CD compliance. I’ve also developed large-scale side projects, such as an AI-based crypto trading platform and a hybrid recommender system, which reinforce my ability to build and ship production-ready features independently.

As an IIT (BHU) graduate with a strong academic foundation in Electrical Engineering (CGPA: 8.95), I pair engineering rigor with practical industry experience. I am particularly excited by opportunities that challenge me to build distributed systems, solve performance bottlenecks, and lead backend modernization efforts.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your team’s success. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely, \\
Gyanendra Singh
